                            <h4>MODULE DESCRIPTION</h4>
                            <p>
                                The module’s purpose is to load a 3D face model with its blendshapes, deform the face
                                using
                                the blendshapes’ values, project this face on a 2D plane and finally return the facial
                                landmarks’ position after projection.<br>
                                The module should act as a black box that gets expected facial blend- shapes, identity
                                blendshapes position and rotation then outputs the facial landmarks projected on a 2D
                                plane
                                corresponding to these input values.<br>
                                The module has to be extremely fast to be called more than once in a real time
                                environment.
                            </p>



                            <h4>APIS AND DEPENDENCIES</h4>
                            <p>To achieve this fast runtime requirmenet, GPU “Graphics Processing Unit” is favourable
                                over
                                the CPU “Central Processing Unit” in this case due to the parallelized nature of this
                                problem, deforming each vertex using blendshapes values and projecting them can be done
                                in
                                parallel with GPU instead of in series with CPU, also rendering the face for debugging
                                comes
                                with no major additional requirements.</p>

                            <p>That’s why OpenGL is selected, OpenGL (Open Graphics Library) is a cross-language,
                                cross-platform application programming interface (API) for rendering 2D and 3D vector
                                graphics. The API is typically used to interact with a graphics processing unit (GPU),
                                to
                                achieve hardware-accelerated rendering.</p>

                            <p>Calling the OpenGL from C++ is chosen for two purposes, to easily export this module as
                                .dll/.lib to be used by other modules. Also to achieve as much speed optimization as
                                possible. OpenGL API is called through GLFW, GLEW. Mathematical functions are called
                                through
                                GLM. Importing and exporting assets is implemented using Assimp.</p>

                            <h3>SUB-MODULES</h3>
                            <h4>RENDERER</h4>
                            <p>This is a straightforward implementation of the OpenGL rendering technique. It starts
                                with
                                importing the face 3D data from file using assimp. It creates the 3D model data
                                structure
                                with given: vertices position and vertices normals. This data structure is sent to the
                                GPU
                                memory to be used.</p>
                            <p>The code that will run on the GPU also called Shaders, is then read from a file and sent
                                to
                                the GPU to process the face data previously sent. Using these data, setting the face
                                position and rotation, and setting an arbitrary location for the light source, a face
                                will
                                be shown on the screen. The light effect comes as an output from the dot product of the
                                vertex normals and the light source position.</p>

                            <h4>BLENDSHAPES DEFORMER</h4>
                            <p>While blendshapes as a concept is relatively easy, implementing this part was the most
                                challenging. Blendshapes in the simplest form a list of vectors that are linearly added
                                after multiplying with weights to the original vertex position to get a new shape.
                                The simplest approach was to save the blendshapes of each vertex along with its normals
                                yet
                                this approach won’t work for a large number of blendshapes, right now there are 118 for
                                expressions and more are added for identities, this approach could have worked for a few
                                number of blendshapes.</p>
                            <p>The solution was to create a large structure that holds all the blendshapes of all
                                vertices
                                together, and save with each vertex the index it should look up within this structure.
                                The
                                structure using OpenGL is called a Texture and data read was saved inside one.
                                In the vertex shader program each vertex has access to the whole blendshapes texture
                                -dealt
                                with as array-, uses its saved index to get what values it should add from this
                                blendshapes
                                by multiplying by array of weights with same values across all vertices, the C++ code
                                provides it in runtime.</p>

                            <h4>PROJECTION FEEDBACK</h4>
                            <p>So far the data is inside our GPU, yet we need to get this data back to be used by other
                                modules (optimizer/regressor), the way to do this is using a transform feedback buffer.
                                A
                                transform Feedback is the process of capturing Primitives generated by the Vertex
                                Processing
                                step, recording data from those primitives into Buffer Objects. This allows one to
                                preserve
                                the post-transform rendering state of an object and resubmit this data multiple times.
                                This
                                feedback buffer will select a property in the shader, in this case we create a property
                                of
                                vector2 for projected values. Using this method will calculate all the vertices
                                projected
                                positions, but we only need the landmarks values.</p>

                            <img src="../assets/images/projects/face-deformer/projection-feedback.jpg" alt="news modal"
                                class="img-fluid modal-feat-img">

                            <p>To get only the landmarks projections values, we need to know their indices in the array,
                                while Assimp changes the indices of vertices while importing, as the 3D model has faces
                                of
                                quads and OpenGL works best with tris. The approach taken was to use blender to export
                                the
                                required vertices as positions not indices and on the C++ side, each vertex is
                                calculating
                                its distance to the required landmarks positions, if the distance is nearly zero then
                                this
                                is a landmarks vertex and saves its index.</p>
