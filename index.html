						<!-- Since my childhood and I was fond of a great story told in anyway from comics, animated short
						movies and games, but games always have a soft spot for me, the ability to engage with your
						character is the best way to feel the story. -->
						I've been fond of great storytelling ever since I was a child, whether
						it was comics, animated movies or games. Yet, games have always been the most
						engaging. Playing a game and interacting with both the story and the environment is an
						immersive experience. This experience is something I want to convey to others.
						<br />
						<!-- I am computer Engineer with a basic understanding of its various branches but eager to learn
						more about computer graphics branch.
						I am also passionate about game development and visual effects
						with experience in developing indie games creating art. -->
						Computer graphics and game development have always been branches of
						interest to me in computer science and it inspired me to build experience in
						developing indie games and creating art for my projects.
						<br />
						<!-- I have used Unity3D and Blender for four years, During those years I have made a lot of projects
						some of them didn't pass the stage of prototyping and some were polished. -->
						I have four years of experience using Unity3D and Blender, throughout these
						years I've developed multiple projects, with some of them getting published
						and showcased.
						<!-- <br />
						I have made indie games for training as well as small games during jams and Ludum Dare.
						I Also have experience making VR Experiences and even developed commercial ones. -->
